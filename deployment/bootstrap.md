In this module, you'll deploy your first complete data engineering solution to Microsoft Fabric:

✅ Deploy a medallion architecture (Bronze → Silver)  
✅ Create and populate Lakehouses with sample data  
✅ Set up data transformation notebooks  
✅ Configure a semantic model and Power BI report  
✅ Validate the end-to-end data flow

## 📋 Module Exercise Flow

You'll complete 5 deployment exercises:

| Exercise | Task | Duration | Status |
|----------|------|----------|--------|
| **1** | Authenticate Fabric CLI | 3 min | ⬜ Ready |
| **2** | Run Bootstrap Deployment | 10 min | ⬜ Ready |
| **3** | Verify Workspace Contents | 5 min | ⬜ Ready |
| **4** | Validate Data in Lakehouses | 5 min | ⬜ Ready |
| **5** | Test Complete Solution | 7 min | ⬜ Ready |

> **Track Your Progress:** Check off each exercise as you complete it!  

> [!TIP]
> **What's a Medallion Architecture?**  
> A data quality pattern where data flows through stages:  
> 🥉 **Bronze**: Raw, unprocessed data  
> 🥈 **Silver**: Cleaned, validated data  
> 🥇 **Gold**: Business-ready analytics data

## 🏗️ What You'll Build

Your deployment will create a complete analytics solution:

```

### Fabric Items You'll Deploy:
| Item | Type | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|  
| **Lakehouse_Bronze** | Lakehouse | Store raw ingested data |
| **Lakehouse_Silver** | Lakehouse | Store processed, clean data |
| **MyLHCopyJob** | Copy Activity | Import external data |
| **Transformations** | Notebook | Process Bronze → Silver |
| **Validations** | Notebook | Check data quality |
| **MySemanticModel** | Semantic Model | Define business logic |
| **MyReport** | Report | Visualize insights |

## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure all items are checked before proceeding:

- ✅ Completed [Module 1: Environment Setup](../configuration/start.md)
- ✅ Terminal/Command Prompt is open
- ✅ Virtual environment is activated (see `(fabric-de-workshop)` in prompt)
- ✅ Logged into Fabric portal with workshop credentials
- ✅ Ready to authenticate fabric-cli (we'll do this next)

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

---

## 📝 Exercise 1: Authenticate Fabric CLI (3 minutes)

> **Goal:** Connect fabric-cli to your Microsoft Fabric account.
>
> [!NOTE]
> This is a one-time setup that persists across sessions.

```bash
# Authenticate with Fabric
fab auth login
```

**What happens:**
1. Browser opens to Microsoft login
2. Sign in with workshop credentials
3. Grant permissions to fabric-cli
4. Return to terminal when complete

**Verify authentication:**
```bash
fab auth status
```

Should list account, tenant id and other information.

### ✅ Exercise 1 Checkpoint

**Before continuing, verify:**
- [ ] Browser opened for authentication
- [ ] Successfully logged in with workshop credentials
- [ ] `fab auth status` shows your email
- [ ] No authentication errors

✨ **Exercise 1 Complete!** Fabric CLI is authenticated.

---

## 📝 Exercise 2: Run Bootstrap Deployment (10 minutes)

> **Goal:** Deploy the complete data engineering solution to your workspace.

### Step 2.1: Navigate to Deployment Directory

```bash
# From the workshop root directory
cd deployment/

# Verify you're in the right place
ls
# You should see: first_deployment.sh, bootstrap.md, etc.
```

### Step 2.2: Execute the Deployment Script

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Replace ```yourusername``` with the name provided by your instructor. Remove the `CICD.` prefix. No email suffix. Lowercase.
> For example: If your user is: **`CICD.user020`**, use **`user020`**
> Replace "Your-Capacity-Name" with the actual capacity name provided by your instructor. 

**For Windows (WSL)/macOS/Linux:**
```bash
./first_deployment.sh \
    --username yourusername \
    --capacity-name "Your-Capacity-Name"
```

> [!TIP]
> **Confirming Your Capacity Name:**
> 1. Go to Fabric portal
> 2. Click Settings (⚙️) → Admin portal
> 3. Select "Capacities"
> 4. Copy the exact capacity name

### Step 3: Monitor the Deployment Progress

> [!NOTE]
> This process takes 5-10 minutes. Each step will show progress indicators.

**What the script does:**

| Stage | Action | Duration |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 1️⃣ | Create workspace `DEWorkshop_<username>` | ~30 sec |
| 2️⃣ | Assign to Fabric capacity | ~10 sec |
| 3️⃣ | Create Bronze & Silver Lakehouses | ~1 min |
| 4️⃣ | Import notebooks and artifacts | ~2 min |
| 5️⃣ | Configure data connections | ~1 min |
| 6️⃣ | Load sample data | ~2 min |
| 7️⃣ | Open workspace in browser | Instant |

## 📝 Exercise 4: Validate Data in Lakehouses (5 minutes)

> **Goal:** Verify that data was successfully loaded into your Lakehouses.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Validations** notebook contains automated checks for all data quality and table counts.

1. **Open the Validations notebook:**
    - Click on **Validations** in your workspace
    - The notebook will open in edit mode

2. **Execute the validation checks:**
    - Make sure MyEnv is selected as the environment
    - Click **Run all** button at the top
    - Wait for all cells to complete (approximately 1-2 minutes)
    - Verify the table counts. The created shortcut to t3 should point to t3_dev in Bronze Lakehouse.

### ✅ Exercise 4 Checkpoint

**Before continuing, verify:**
- [ ] Bronze Lakehouse has `dbo.t2` table with data
- [ ] Silver Lakehouse has all 4 tables (t1, t2, t3)
- [ ] All tables contain rows (not empty)
- [ ] Can preview data without errors

📦 **Exercise 4 Complete!** Data is loaded correctly.

---

## 📝 Exercise 5: Test Complete Solution (7 minutes)

> **Goal:** Validate the end-to-end solution including transformations and reporting.

### Step 5.1: Run Data Quality Checks

> [!TIP]
> This helps you understand the data flow and validates transformations

1. Open **Validations** notebook
2. Click **Run all** button
3. Review output showing:
   - Row counts for each table
   - Data quality metrics
   - Schema validations
4. All checks should pass ✅

### Step 5.2: Test Semantic Model and Report

#### 📊 Verify Semantic Model:
1. Open **MySemanticModel**
2. Check data source connection:
   - Should point to `Lakehouse_Silver`
   - Table `dbo.t1` should be imported
3. Click **Refresh now** to update data

#### 📈 Open the Report:
1. Click on **MyReport**
2. Report should display:
   - Dashboard with charts
   - Interactive filters
   - No error messages
3. Try interacting with filters to ensure responsiveness

> [!SUCCESS]
> **Congratulations!** You've deployed your first Fabric solution! 🎉

### ✅ Exercise 5 Checkpoint

**Before continuing, verify:**
- [ ] Validations notebook ran successfully
- [ ] All data quality checks passed
- [ ] Semantic model refreshed without errors
- [ ] Report displays charts and data
- [ ] Filters work interactively

🎆 **Exercise 5 Complete!** Your solution is fully operational!

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Quick Fixes

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| **"Workspace already exists"** | Delete it: `fab rm -f /DEWorkshop_<username>` |
| **"Not authenticated"** | Run: `fab auth login` |
| **"Capacity not found"** | Check exact capacity name in Admin Portal |
| **"Permission denied"** | Ensure you have workspace admin rights |
| **Script not executable** | Mac/Linux: Run `chmod +x first_deployment.sh` |
| **Tables missing data** | Re-run the deployment script |
| **Report shows errors** | Refresh semantic model first |

### Helpful Commands

```bash
# Create workspace manually before running first_deployment.sh if needed.
fab create DEWorkshop_<username>.Workspace

# Assign capacity manually before running first_deployment.sh if needed.
fab ls .capacities
fab assign .capacities/"MY CAPACITY NAME.Capacity" -W DEWorkshop_<username>.Workspace

# View workspace contents
fab ls /DEWorkshop_<username>

# Get help on any command
fab --help
fab create --help
```

   - [ ] Authentication problems resolved
   - [ ] Deployment script errors fixed
   - [ ] Workspace permissions corrected
3. Time elapsed vs. planned: ___ minutes
```

#### 🚨 **Common Issues at This Stage**
- **Missing tables**: Run `Transformations.Notebook` again
- **Report not loading**: Check semantic model refresh
- **Git not syncing**: Verify branch connection in workspace settings

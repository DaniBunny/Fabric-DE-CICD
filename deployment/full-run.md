# Module 6: End-to-End Pipeline - Three-Stage Deployment

> [!NOTE]
> **Duration:** 45 minutes | **Difficulty:** Intermediate | [‚Üê Back to Deployment Pipelines](./start.md) | [Next: Azure DevOps ‚Üí](./azuredevops.md)

## Overview

Complete your enterprise deployment pipeline by adding a Test stage between Development and Production. Apply the knowledge gained from Modules 4 and 5 to create a three-stage promotion flow (Dev ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Prod) with proper branch management, variable configuration, and end-to-end validation.

In this module, you'll use what you've learned to:
- Create a Test environment using branch out strategies from Module 4
- Configure deployment rules and variables using patterns from Module 5
- Execute and validate a complete three-stage deployment pipeline

## Learning Objectives

- Apply Module 4 learnings: Create Test workspace and branch using branch out strategy
- Apply Module 5 learnings: Configure three-stage variable library and deployment rules
- Update variable libraries for three-stage environment management
- Execute complete deployment pipeline
- Validate data processing, transformation, and reporting across all stages
- Troubleshoot and resolve deployment issues independently

## Prerequisites

- **Successfully completed Module 5** with working two-stage deployment pipeline
- Functional deployment pipeline: Development ‚Üí Production
- Working variable library with Dev/Prod configurations
- All deployment rules functioning correctly from Module 5
- Current workspace setup:
  - `DEWorkshop_<username>` (Development - main branch)
  - `DEWorkshop_<username>_Prod` (Production - production branch)

## Part 1: Apply Module 4 - Create Test Environment

### High-Level Objective

Use the branch out strategy you learned in Module 4 to create a Test environment between Development and Production.

### Tasks

> [!TIP]
> **Apply Module 4 Knowledge**: You successfully created a Production workspace using branch out. Now apply the same pattern to create a Test workspace.

#### Task 1.1: Create Test Workspace Using Branch Out

1. **Use Fabric Branch Out capability**
   - From your `DEWorkshop_<username>` workspace
   - Branch out to create `DEWorkshop_<username>_Test`
   - Connect to the `test` branch in Azure DevOps

#### Task 1.2: Verify Test Environment

1. **Confirm workspace creation**
   - Test workspace should have all items from development
   - Git integration should point to `test` branch
   - Use all validation techniques from Module 4

> **Expected Result**: You now have three workspaces:
> - `DEWorkshop_<username>` (Development - main branch)
> - `DEWorkshop_<username>_Test` (Test - test branch)  
> - `DEWorkshop_<username>_Prod` (Production - production branch)

## Part 2: Apply Module 5 - Configure Three-Stage Pipeline

### High-Level Objective

Apply the deployment pipeline configuration skills from Module 5 to create a three-stage pipeline with proper variable libraries and deployment rules.

### Tasks

> [!TIP]
> **Apply Module 5 Knowledge**: You successfully configured a two-stage pipeline with variables and rules. Now extend that pattern to three stages.

#### Task 2.1: Rebuild Deployment Pipeline

1. **Navigate to DEWorkshop_<username> workspace**
   - Click on **View deployment pipelines**
   - Click on the ellipsis `...` and select **Delete pipeline** from the drop menu.
   - **Confirm** deletion when prompted. The `DEWorkshop_<username>_Pipeline` pipeline is now deleted.

2. **Create new three-stage pipeline**
   - Name: `DEWorkshop_<username>_Pipeline_3Stage`
   - Stages: Development ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Production
   - Assign workspaces to each stage

#### Task 2.2: Configure Three-Stage Variable Library

1. **Extend variable library**
   - Add Test stage variables to your existing variable library
   - Use the same pattern you learned in Module 5

#### Task 2.3: Configure Three-Stage Deployment Rules

1. **Apply deployment rules pattern**
   - Use the same deployment rules from Module 5
   - Extend to include Test stage in the rule configurations
   - Test stage should use same rule patterns as Production

> **Expected Result**: Three-stage deployment pipeline with working variable library and deployment rules.

## Part 3: Execute Three-Stage Deployment

### High-Level Objective

Execute a complete deployment from Development ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Production, applying validation patterns from Module 5.

### Tasks

> [!TIP]
> **Apply Module 5 Knowledge**: You successfully executed deployment pipeline automation. Now execute the same pattern across three stages.

#### Task 3.1: Deploy Development ‚Üí Test

1. **Execute first deployment**
   - Deploy from Development to Test stage
   - Apply the same validation steps you learned in Module 5
   - Verify deployment rules executed correctly.

> [!TIP]
> You'll notice that the shortcuts didn't remap. Make sure you made the Variable Set from MyVarLib as Active in the DEWorkshop_<username>_Test workspace. Make sure you update all variables in the Lakehouse Silver before Transformation notebook execution.

#### Task 3.2: Validate Test Environment

1. **Run comprehensive validation**
   - Execute Copy Jobs in Test workspace
   - Run required notebooks
   - Confirm if all tables, shortcuts, semantic models are pointing to the right place
   - Test the Validations notebook and run the MyReport report

#### Task 3.3: Deploy Test ‚Üí Production  

1. **Execute second deployment**
   - Deploy from Test to Production stage  
   - Use same validation approach from Module 5
   - Verify all connections and rules work properly

2. **Run comprehensive validation**
   - Execute Copy Jobs in Test workspace (if needed)
   - Run required notebooks (if needed)
   - Confirm if all tables, shortcuts, semantic models are pointing to the right place
   - Test the Validations notebook and run the MyReport report

> **Expected Result**: Complete three-stage pipeline execution with data flowing Development ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Production.

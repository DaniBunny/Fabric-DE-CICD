# Module 3: Version Control Basics - Mastering Git Integration

> [!NOTE]
> **Duration:** 30 minutes | **Difficulty:** Intermediate | [← Back to Deployment](../deployment/bootstrap.md) | [Next: Branch Management →](../deployment/branch-out.md)

## 🎯 Module Objectives

Learn the fundamental Git workflows that enable team collaboration:

✅ Connect your Fabric workspace to a Git repository  
✅ Push changes from Fabric to Git (Fabric → Git)  
✅ Pull changes from Git to Fabric (Git → Fabric)  
✅ Understand what gets versioned (and what doesn't)  
✅ Handle conflicts and synchronization issues  

> [!TIP]
> **Why Version Control?**  
> Git integration enables multiple developers to work on the same solution, track changes, review code, and deploy safely across environments.

An important pattern to understand is that once your workspace is connected to Git, updates made from git to Fabric affect all users of that workspace.

To achieve isolation, workspaces should be connected to feature branches or separate branches for each environment (development, test, production). This way, changes can be tested in isolation before being merged into the main branch that is connected to the production workspace. There are multiple strategies and Fabric is flexible to support various branching models.

Refer to the [Best practices for CI/CD in Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/best-practices-cicd) for more information.

> 
> [!NOTE]
> This simulates your daily workflow of developing in Fabric and saving changes.

### Step 2.1: Modify a Lakehouse Shortcut

1. **Open Lakehouse_Silver:**
   - Click on `Lakehouse_Silver` in your workspace
   - Expand **Tables** section
   - Find the `t3` shortcut

2. **Rename the shortcut:**
   - Click **⋯** (ellipsis) next to `t3`
   - Select **Manage shortcut**
   - Change **Name** from `t3` to `t3_test`
   - Click **Check icon to save**

3. **Verify the change:**
   - Click **⋯** → **Refresh** on Tables section
   - Confirm `t3_test` appears instead of `t3`
   - Click on `t3_test` to preview data

### Step 2.2: Commit Changes to Git

1. **Open Source Control panel:**
   - Click **Source control** button in workspace header
   - You'll see pending changes:
   ```
   📝 Changes (1)
   M  Lakehouse_Silver
   ```

    ![Pending changes](../screenshots/versioning-start-push-changes-to-git.png)

2. **Review and commit:**
   - Click **Changes** to see details
   - Add commit message:
   ```
   feat: Renamed table shortcut t3 to t3_test

   ```json
   "name": "t3_test"  // Changed from "t3"
   ```

    ![Changes in DevOps](../screenshots/versioning-start-devops-with-changes.png)

> [!WARNING]
> **Critical Concept: Dependencies**  
> When you rename database objects (tables, shortcuts), you MUST update all dependent code:  
> - Notebooks referencing the table
> - Semantic models using the table
> - Reports with direct queries
> 
> Always commit these changes together to maintain consistency!

### ✅ Exercise 3 Checkpoint

**Before continuing, verify:**
- [ ] Shortcut renamed to `t3_test` in Fabric
- [ ] Changes committed to Git with message
- [ ] Commit visible in Azure DevOps history
- [ ] `shortcuts.metadata.json` shows the new name

🎯 **Exercise 3 Complete!** You've pushed changes from Fabric to Git.

> **Goal:** Edit files directly in Git and sync changes back to Fabric.
>
> [!NOTE]
> This simulates receiving changes from teammates or making quick fixes in Git.
> 
> **DevOps Pattern:** We'll "fix forward" rather than reverting - this maintains a clean history.

### Step 3.1: Edit in Azure DevOps

1. **Navigate to the file:**
   - In Azure DevOps, go to **Repos** → **Files**
   - Browse to:
   ```
   DE_Workshop/
   └── Lakehouse_Silver.Lakehouse/
       └── shortcuts.metadata.json
   ```

2. **Edit the file:**
   - Click **Edit** button
   - Find this line:
   ```json
   "name": "t3_test"
   ```
   - Change it back to:
   ```json
   "name": "t3"
   ```

3. **Commit the fix:**
   - Commit message:
   ```
   fix: Revert shortcut name back to t3
   ```
   - Click **Commit**

    ![Fixes in DevOps](../screenshots/versioning-start-devops-fix-name-commit.png)

### Step 3.2: Pull Changes to Fabric

1. **Check for updates:**
   - Return to Fabric workspace
   - Notice the banner:
   ```
   ⚠️ Updates available from Git
   ```
   - Or click **Source control** to see:
   ```
   ↓ 1 incoming change
   ```

2. **Pull the changes:**
   - Click **Updates** tab
   - Review what will be updated:
   ```
   Incoming changes:
   ~ Lakehouse_Silver (modified)
   ```
   - Click **Update all**

    ![Updates from git](../screenshots/versioning-start-pull-updates-from-git.png)

3. **Verify the fix:**
   - Open `Lakehouse_Silver`
   - Refresh Tables section
   - Confirm `t3` is back (not `t3_test`)
   - Preview data to ensure it works

> [!SUCCESS]
> You've completed a full round-trip: Fabric → Git → Fabric! 🔄

### ✅ Exercise 4 Checkpoint

**Before continuing, verify:**
- [ ] File edited in Azure DevOps and committed
- [ ] Fabric shows "Updates available" notification
- [ ] Updates pulled successfully to workspace
- [ ] Shortcut renamed back to `t3` in Lakehouse_Silver

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| **"Updates available" won't go away** | Local changes conflict | Commit or discard local changes first |
| **"Permission denied" on commit** | No write access to repo | Ask admin for Contributor role |
| **Items missing after sync** | Wrong folder path | Check Git integration settings |
| **Sync seems stuck** | Large artifacts | Wait 2-3 minutes, then refresh |
| **Can't see Git options** | Not workspace admin | Request admin access |

### Quick Fixes:

```bash
# Check sync status
Click Source control → View status

# Force refresh
F5 or Ctrl+R in browser

# Disconnect and reconnect
Workspace settings → Git integration → Disconnect
```

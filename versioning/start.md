# Module 3: Version Control Basics - Mastering Git Integration

> [!NOTE]
> **Duration:** 30 minutes | **Difficulty:** Intermediate | [‚Üê Back to Deployment](../deployment/bootstrap.md) | [Next: Branch Management ‚Üí](../deployment/branch-out.md)

## üéØ Module Objectives

Learn the fundamental Git workflows that enable team collaboration:

‚úÖ Connect your Fabric workspace to a Git repository  
‚úÖ Push changes from Fabric to Git (Fabric ‚Üí Git)  
‚úÖ Pull changes from Git to Fabric (Git ‚Üí Fabric)  
‚úÖ Understand what gets versioned (and what doesn't)  
‚úÖ Handle conflicts and synchronization issues  

> [!TIP]
> **Why Version Control?**  
> Git integration enables multiple developers to work on the same solution, track changes, review code, and deploy safely across environments.

An important pattern to understand is that once your workspace is connected to Git, updates made from git to Fabric affect all users of that workspace.

To achieve isolation, workspaces should be connected to feature branches or separate branches for each environment (development, test, production). This way, changes can be tested in isolation before being merged into the main branch that is connected to the production workspace. There are multiple strategies and Fabric is flexible to support various branching models.

Refer to the [Best practices for CI/CD in Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/cicd/best-practices-cicd) for more information.

## üìù Exercise 1: Setup Azure DevOps Project (5 minutes)

> **Goal:** Create your personal Azure DevOps project and initialize Git repository for the workshop.

### Step 1.1: Login to Azure DevOps

1. **Navigate to Azure DevOps:**
   - Open your browser to: `https://dev.azure.com/FabConEU`
   - Use the workshop credentials provided by your instructor

2. **Verify access:**
   - You should see the Azure DevOps dashboard
   - Click on the "FabConEU_DEWorkshop" project

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the exact credentials provided by your instructor for this workshop.

### Step 1.2: Fork Repository

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use the exact username provided by your instructor for this workshop.
> This is a shared Azure DevOps project for the workshop, getting your username wrong will affect the workshop downstream and can also interfere with the work of other attendees.

1. **Navigate to Repos:**
   - Click **Repos** in the left navigation
   - Click on **Files** in the left navigation
   - You should see the files for the User000 repository by default

![Azure DevOps git repo User000](../screenshots/versioning-start-user000-repo.png)

2. **Fork the repositoru:**
   - Click **Initialize** button in the empty repository
   - Check ‚òëÔ∏è **Add a README**
   - Leave ‚òê **Add a .gitignore** unchecked
   - Click **Initialize**

## üìù Exercise 3: Fabric ‚Üí Git Workflow (10 minutes)

> **Goal:** Make a change in Fabric and push it to your Git repository.
> 
> [!NOTE]
> This simulates your daily workflow of developing in Fabric and saving changes.

### Step 2.1: Modify a Lakehouse Shortcut

1. **Open Lakehouse_Silver:**
   - Click on `Lakehouse_Silver` in your workspace
   - Expand **Tables** section
   - Find the `t3` shortcut

2. **Rename the shortcut:**
   - Click **‚ãØ** (ellipsis) next to `t3`
   - Select **Manage shortcut**
   - Change **Name** from `t3` to `t3_test`
   - Click **Check icon to save**

3. **Verify the change:**
   - Click **‚ãØ** ‚Üí **Refresh** on Tables section
   - Confirm `t3_test` appears instead of `t3`
   - Click on `t3_test` to preview data

### Step 2.2: Commit Changes to Git

1. **Open Source Control panel:**
   - Click **Source control** button in workspace header
   - You'll see pending changes:
   ```
   üìù Changes (1)
   M  Lakehouse_Silver
   ```

    ![Pending changes](../screenshots/versioning-start-push-changes-to-git.png)

2. **Review and commit:**
   - Click **Changes** to see details
   - Add commit message:
   ```
   feat: Renamed table shortcut t3 to t3_test
   ```
   - Click **Commit**

3. **Verify in Azure DevOps:**
   - Go to **Repos** ‚Üí **Commits**
   - Find your commit with timestamp
   - Click to view changed files
   - Check `shortcuts.metadata.json` shows:
   ```json
   "name": "t3_test"  // Changed from "t3"
   ```

    ![Changes in DevOps](../screenshots/versioning-start-devops-with-changes.png)

> [!WARNING]
> **Critical Concept: Dependencies**  
> When you rename database objects (tables, shortcuts), you MUST update all dependent code:  
> - Notebooks referencing the table
> - Semantic models using the table
> - Reports with direct queries
> 
> Always commit these changes together to maintain consistency!

### ‚úÖ Exercise 3 Checkpoint

**Before continuing, verify:**
- [ ] Shortcut renamed to `t3_test` in Fabric
- [ ] Changes committed to Git with message
- [ ] Commit visible in Azure DevOps history
- [ ] `shortcuts.metadata.json` shows the new name

üéØ **Exercise 3 Complete!** You've pushed changes from Fabric to Git.

> **Goal:** Edit files directly in Git and sync changes back to Fabric.
>
> [!NOTE]
> This simulates receiving changes from teammates or making quick fixes in Git.
> 
> **DevOps Pattern:** We'll "fix forward" rather than reverting - this maintains a clean history.

### Step 3.1: Edit in Azure DevOps

1. **Navigate to the file:**
   - In Azure DevOps, go to **Repos** ‚Üí **Files**
   - Browse to:
   ```
   DE_Workshop/

   ```

2. **Edit the file:**
   - Click **Edit** button
   - Find this line:
   ```json
   "name": "t3_test"
   ```
   - Change it back to:
   ```json
   "name": "t3"
   ```

3. **Commit the fix:**
   - Commit message:
   ```
   fix: Revert shortcut name back to t3
   ```
   - Click **Commit**

    ![Fixes in DevOps](../screenshots/versioning-start-devops-fix-name-commit.png)

### Step 3.2: Pull Changes to Fabric

1. **Check for updates:**
   - Return to Fabric workspace
   - Notice the banner:
   ```
   ‚ö†Ô∏è Updates available from Git
   ```
   - Or click **Source control** to see:
   ```
   ‚Üì 1 incoming change
   ```

2. **Pull the changes:**
   - Click **Updates** tab
   - Review what will be updated:
   ```
   Incoming changes:
   ~ Lakehouse_Silver (modified)
   ```
   - Click **Update all**

    ![Updates from git](../screenshots/versioning-start-pull-updates-from-git.png)

3. **Verify the fix:**
   - Open `Lakehouse_Silver`
   - Refresh Tables section
   - Confirm `t3` is back (not `t3_test`)
   - Preview data to ensure it works

> [!SUCCESS]
> You've completed a full round-trip: Fabric ‚Üí Git ‚Üí Fabric! üîÑ

### ‚úÖ Exercise 4 Checkpoint
